                <h3>Crunch at Rockstar Games</h3>

                <p>As many people familiar with the video game industry already know, one of the biggest problems faced by developers is the crunch culture that permeates the industry. For those who may not be familiar with the term “crunch”, it refers to the practice of forcing or coercing developers to put in overtime in the effort of avoiding delays to a game’s release; many companies have enveloped in scandals over this culture, such as Epic Games (Fortnite) and Naughty Dog (TLOU 2). One company that I was disappointed to hear was using this practice was Rockstar Games, shortly after the release of Read Dead Redemption 2 in 2018. According to Kotaku, a last-minute addition to the already filmed cinematic cutscenes, wound up adding several weeks of extra work in the final year of this title’s development. It is also reported that this was not an exception, but part of the norm at Rockstar Games, where the creative leads of RDR2 were reported to be “renowned for rebooting, overhauling, and discarding large chunks of their games”. As someone who has studied computer science and some experience in game prototyping and design, I understand the necessity in having multiple iterations of a product before its actually released, but when stories 80 to 100 hour weeks are a norm and not an exception, I’m inclined to think these companies are unable to assess the amount of work it takes to make games and how to schedule accordingly.</p>

                <h3>Highlights Of Xbox Showcase 2023</h3>
                <address>Adam Collier</address>

                <p>Microsoft hosted their Xbox Showcase for this year, and they revealed a lot of exiting news for the future of Xbox and gaming in general. I’m going to go through my personal highlights of the showcase and what games I’m most excited about. The game I am, by far, most excited about from this showcase Is Ubisoft’s Star Wars Outlaws, which has been slated to release sometime in 2024. I, along with many people in the gaming community, have been eager to see another company take a shot at a Star Wars game after watching EA fumble the ball title after title, from the Battlefront 2 loot box scandal to the buggy and unoptimized launch of Jedi Survivor this year. The next big reveal that had me hyped was for Payday 3, which will be coming September 21 of this year. The trailer showcased a lot of the new features and mechanics that can be expected in the newest installment of this franchise and seems to be an ambitious step up from Payday 2, which was released about a decade ago. The third biggest reveal came from Obsidian Entertainment trailer for Avowed, their newest Fantasy rpg, which has been set to release in 2024. Many RPG gamers, my self-included, are hyped to see what we will be getting next from the company that has dominated the rpg market for decades, with many award-winning games like Fallout: New Vegas under its belt. </p>
